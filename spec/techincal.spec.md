# Threadwork Rewrite — Technical Specification

## 1. Project Objective

The application is a desktop visual orchestration editor for designing software systems, workflows, and generated projects through a hierarchy of connected nodes.

The rewrite shall use Kotlin as the primary implementation language.

The system shall consist of:

```text
- Kotlin desktop application
- shared Kotlin core model module
- in-memory document repository
- JSON save/load persistence
- canvas-based visual editor
- CodeMirror code editor embedded in WebView
- metadata-aware completion service
- compiler plugin interface
- first naive source-code compiler
```

The rewrite should preserve the successful conceptual model from the current implementation while reducing architectural complexity.

## 3. Technology Stack

### 3.1 Primary Language

```text
Kotlin
```

Kotlin shall be used for:

```text
- core model
- application services
- desktop UI
- storage
- compiler backend
- completion engine
- build/run orchestration
```

---

### 3.2 Desktop UI

Recommended UI framework:

```text
Compose Multiplatform for Desktop
```

The UI shall be a desktop application, not a browser-first application.

The browser dependency shall be isolated to the embedded code editor only.

---

### 3.3 Code Editor

Recommended editor:

```text
CodeMirror 6 embedded in WebView
```

The CodeMirror integration must be hidden behind a Kotlin-side adapter.

The rest of the application must not depend directly on CodeMirror APIs.

---

### 3.4 Serialization

Recommended serialization:

```text
kotlinx.serialization
```

The document model shall be serializable to and from JSON.

The storage backend shall initially be an in-memory Java/Kotlin object graph that can be saved to and loaded from a JSON file.

Kotlin serialization supports serializable Kotlin classes and JSON encode/decode workflows.

---

## 4. Module Structure

Recommended Gradle module layout:

```text
threadwork/
├── settings.gradle.kts
├── build.gradle.kts
├── core/
├── storage-json/
├── app-desktop/
├── editor-codemirror/
├── compiler-api/
├── compilers-impl/
└── test-fixtures/
```

---

## 5. Module Responsibilities

### 5.1 `core`

Contains shared entities and pure domain logic.

Responsibilities:

```text
- define Node
- define NodeId
- define document model
- define layout model
- define text section model
- define metadata model
- define port model
- define link model
- define diagnostics
- define validation primitives
- define tree traversal helpers
```

Must not depend on:

```text
- Compose UI
- WebView
- CodeMirror
- filesystem APIs, except if unavoidable for simple value types
- compiler implementation modules
```

---

### 5.2 `storage-json`

Contains in-memory repository and JSON persistence.

Responsibilities:

```text
- hold active document in memory
- provide repository operations
- save document as JSON
- load document from JSON
- track dirty state
- assign ids
- validate references after load
```

This module replaces the current database backend for the rewrite MVP.

The old MariaDB model is useful as prior art, but not required for the first rewrite.

---

### 5.3 `app-desktop`

Contains the Compose desktop application.

Responsibilities:

```text
- main application window
- menu bar
- project open/save actions
- left hierarchy tree
- central canvas graph view
- right inspector/help panel
- bottom or tabbed node editor panel
- selection handling
- command routing
```

Must communicate with the document through services/repositories.

Must not directly mutate low-level fields in uncontrolled ways.

---

### 5.4 `editor-codemirror`

Contains the WebView and CodeMirror bridge.

Responsibilities:

```text
- load CodeMirror editor HTML/JS bundle
- expose Kotlin editor adapter
- send document text to editor
- receive text changes from editor
- receive cursor position
- send completion items to editor
- send diagnostics to editor
- switch language mode
- switch theme
```

Must not own the node model.

Must not know business semantics except through editor context passed to it.

---

### 5.5 `compiler-api`

Contains compiler extension interfaces.

Responsibilities:

```text
- define CompilerPlugin
- define CompilerContext
- define GeneratedProject
- define GeneratedFile
- define BuildResult
- define compiler diagnostics
```

---

### 5.6 `compilers-impl`

First compiler implementation.

Responsibilities:

```text
- consume node hierarchy
- generate Kotlin/JVM project files
- generate source files for terminal processing nodes
- generate composite runner files
- generate link-transfer code
- optionally invoke Gradle or Kotlin compiler
```

This compiler should be deliberately boring and deterministic.

It should not attempt concurrency.

---

## 6. Core Object Model

### 6.1 Single Node Class

The core object model shall use one primary class:

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class Node(
    val id: NodeId,
    var name: String,
    var kind: NodeKind,
    var parentId: NodeId? = null,
    val children: MutableList<NodeId> = mutableListOf(),
    val incomingLinks: MutableList<NodeId> = mutableListOf(),
    val outgoingLinks: MutableList<NodeId> = mutableListOf(),
    var layout: NodeLayout = NodeLayout(),
    var text: NodeText = NodeText(),
    var technology: TechnologyMetadata = TechnologyMetadata(),
    val ports: MutableList<NodePort> = mutableListOf(),
    var link: LinkData? = null,
    var metadata: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf()
)
```

The system shall avoid separate subclasses such as:

```text
ProcessorNode
CompositeNode
LinkNode
```

Instead, semantic roles shall be inferred from:

```text
- kind
- children
- link data
- ports
- compiler rules
```

---

### 6.2 Node Identity

```kotlin
@Serializable
@JvmInline
value class NodeId(val value: String)
```

Node ids shall be stable across save/load.

Ids should not be derived from names.

Repository-generated node and link ids shall be UUID-backed values, for example
`node_0187c9cb-b0b3-49bb-89f5-5c72fc0c7b7b` or
`link_7d1f3142-d480-428a-bf45-cb5998f2a96f`. Counters are not acceptable for
new ids because opened documents may already contain arbitrary historical ids.

---

### 6.3 Node Kind

```kotlin
@Serializable
enum class NodeKind {
    Node,
    Processor,
    Link,
    Group,
    Type,
    Note
}
```

The compiler may interpret `NodeKind.Group` with children as a composite.

The compiler may interpret `NodeKind.Processor` with children as a composite processor.

`NodeKind.Type` declares a shared structured payload contract. It is not a normal
data-flow endpoint.

The model shall allow flexible interpretation.

---

### 6.4 Node Layout

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class NodeLayout(
    var x: Double = 0.0,
    var y: Double = 0.0,
    var width: Double = 200.0,
    var height: Double = 100.0
)
```

This corresponds to the current implementation’s `anchor` and `size`.

The visual layout is part of the document.

---

### 6.5 Node Text Sections

Each node shall have four main text fields:

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class NodeText(
    var source: String = "",
    var specification: String = "",
    var tests: String = "",
    var aiInstructions: String = ""
)
```

Meaning:

```text
source
    Implementation text or code.

specification
    Human or machine-readable description of intended behavior.

tests
    Unit tests, examples, validation data, or manual tests.

aiInstructions
    Instructions for coding agents.
```

---

### 6.6 Technology Metadata

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class TechnologyMetadata(
    var languageId: String = "",
    var technologyId: String = "",
    var compilerId: String = "",
    var fileExtension: String = "",
    var contentType: String = ""
)
```

Examples:

```json
{
  "languageId": "kotlin",
  "technologyId": "kotlin-jvm",
  "compilerId": "naive-kotlin",
  "fileExtension": "kt",
  "contentType": "text/x-kotlin"
}
```

This replaces the previous `TECHNOLANG` and node-local technology JSON in the first rewrite.

A later version may reintroduce a technology catalog.

---

### 6.7 Ports

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class NodePort(
    val id: String,
    var name: String,
    var direction: PortDirection,
    var dataType: String = "",
    var metadata: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf()
)
```

```kotlin
@Serializable
enum class PortDirection {
    Input,
    Output
}
```

Ports are used by:

```text
- links
- compiler
- code suggestions
- graph rendering
- validation
```

---

### 6.8 Link Data

Links are nodes.

A link node has `kind = NodeKind.Link` and non-null `link`.

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class LinkData(
    var sourceNodeId: NodeId,
    var sourcePortName: String,
    var targetNodeId: NodeId,
    var targetPortName: String,
    var interactionKind: String = "auto",
    var transportKind: String = "packet",
    var typeName: String = "",
    var payloadDefinition: String = "",
    var typeDefinitionId: String = "",
    var compositeBoundaryIds: MutableList<NodeId> = mutableListOf()
)
```

Each link connects exactly one output to one input.

The link node name identifies the wire or variable instance.
`typeDefinitionId` selects a built-in type or a first-class Type node shared by
all links carrying that structure. Type nodes contain named fields whose types
are built-ins or other Type IDs, plus a compiler-interpreted reference flag.
`typeName` and `payloadDefinition` remain legacy compiler fallbacks.

The repository owns link topology invariants. It stores each link under its
endpoints' closest common ancestor and records each crossed composite in
`compositeBoundaryIds`. Links cannot use links or Type declarations as normal
data endpoints.

### 6.9 Link Interaction Kinds and Compiled Capabilities

`transportKind` describes how ordinary data is transported. It must not also be
used to describe whether a link carries data or grants access to a compiled
capability. `interactionKind` provides that independent semantic dimension:

```text
auto  - compatibility mode; apply the historical classifier
data  - ordinary unidirectional, double-buffered FBP transport
lib   - lifecycle-scoped library/service instance capability
src   - synchronous customized source-product capability
run   - synchronous customized runnable-product capability
```

New links default to `data`. The serialized default remains `auto` so documents
written before this field existed retain their name-, endpoint-, and
`transportKind`-based classification. Changing a link name must not change an
explicit non-`auto` interaction kind.

A capability link is directed from provider to consumer. For:

```text
A --src--> B
```

`B` receives a compiler-named local capability argument representing `A`; `A`
does not push a source string into a FIFO. The same direction rule applies to
`lib` and `run`. The direction therefore describes capability provision, while
the method call carries request parameters from the consumer to the provider and
returns the result to the consumer.

The generated execution contract is synchronous in the first implementation:

```text
sourceCapability.getSource(parameters) -> source product
runnableCapability.getRunnable(parameters) -> runnable product
```

The consumer may call either operation on every execution frame. `parameters`
are build/configuration values controlled by the consumer and the result is
returned directly in the same call. Compilers determine the concrete parameter
and product types for their technology. A compiler that cannot produce the
requested capability shall report an actionable compilation diagnostic rather
than silently compiling it as data transport.

`lib` retains the existing dependency-injection lifecycle: the generated
library instance is allocated once in its owning generated scope, assigned an
indexed allocation symbol, and passed to consumers through an unindexed
processor argument. Compiler-provided link and service argument symbols preserve
valid model spelling, including underscores; only characters illegal in the
target identifier are sanitized.
`src` and `run` follow the same allocation and argument naming rules but
allocate a compiler-generated capability facade.

Capability links never generate A/B FIFO buffers or a transport-phase function.
They are excluded from the data input count used to classify generators,
transformers, and sinks. Compiler template contexts expose all capability links,
plus separate library, source, and runnable subsets. Descriptors expose the
interaction kind, allocation symbol, local argument symbol, provider identity,
callable method, parameter contract, and generated product contract.

A scoped compilation that contains a capability consumer shall transitively
include the capability link and its provider subtree. This rule applies
recursively to capabilities consumed by that provider. Ordinary data neighbors
remain excluded unless both endpoints are already in scope. Output delegated to
another compiler is retained as that provider's compiled product for `src`.

Asynchronous compilation may later be exposed as a compiler-owned
`Future`/`Promise`-like result. It must preserve the same single capability link
and hide scheduling queues behind that API. Explicit request and response FIFO
links remain available as an advanced ordinary-FBP design, but are not the
default representation of a compiled capability.

### 6.10 Capability Link Presentation

Explicit `lib`, `src`, and `run` links use the same dependency annotation
geometry as library links. The provider is represented by a right-edge
annotation and the consumer by a top-edge dependency list, so capability links
do not consume ordinary node port space or compete with data routes. `src` and
`run` use their own palette colors to remain distinct from `lib`; selection,
hit-testing, SVG, and print rendering use the same geometry and semantics as
the interactive canvas. The annotation label retains the link and provider
identity needed to distinguish multiple capabilities.

Hover and editor completion for a consumer expose the compiler-generated local
argument and the callable contract. At minimum `src` advertises `getSource` and
`run` advertises `getRunnable`; `lib` advertises the service instance type and
members already provided by compiler code intelligence.

### 6.11 Capability Implementation Stages

The capability feature shall be implemented through the existing module
boundaries:

```text
1. core: interaction-kind catalog, model field, classification, validation
2. storage-json: default/legacy compatibility and repository normalization
3. compiler-api: capability descriptors and editor code-intelligence symbols
4. compilers-impl: capability template context, no-FIFO generation, facades
5. app-desktop: interaction editor and top/bottom capability rendering
6. tests: model compatibility, classification, compiler output, UI geometry helpers
```

The implementation must preserve the existing dependency-injection syntax and
generated allocation behavior for historical `usage`, `dependency`, and
library-name conventions while making all new behavior explicit in the model.

The initial built-in compiler support matrix is:

| Compiler | `lib` | `src` | `run` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Node.js | supported | supported | supported |
| Kotlin/JVM | supported | supported | rejected with a diagnostic |
| PHP | supported | supported | rejected with a diagnostic |
| C | supported | supported | rejected with a diagnostic |
| Go | supported | supported | rejected with a diagnostic |

For `src`, the returned product is the provider node's compiler-generated
declaration after parameter interpolation, not the raw declaration field from
the document. Node.js `run` evaluates that same generated product and returns
the provider's exported callable. Native backends shall remain explicit about
unsupported executable-product loading until a concrete artifact ABI and
loading lifecycle are defined.

---

## 7. Document Model

The active project shall be represented by a document object:

```kotlin
@Serializable
data class ThreadworkDocument(
    val id: String,
    var name: String,
    var rootNodeId: NodeId,
    val nodes: MutableMap<NodeId, Node> = mutableMapOf(),
    var metadata: MutableMap<String, String> = mutableMapOf()
)
```

The document owns all nodes.

Node hierarchy is represented by:

```text
node.parentId
node.children
```

Graph communication is represented by:

```text
link nodes
node.incomingLinks
node.outgoingLinks
```

When classifying a node as a generator, transformer, sink, or generic
processing unit, inbound usage/dependency links from service-library nodes do
not count as data inputs. They express imports or dependencies, not transported
runtime data.

The repository must keep these references consistent.

---

## 8. In-Memory Repository

### 8.1 Repository Purpose

The storage backend shall initially be an in-memory object repository.

It shall behave like a small document database, but without external database dependency.

The repository holds one active document.

---

### 8.2 Repository Interface

```kotlin
interface DocumentRepository {
    fun getDocument(): ThreadworkDocument

    fun getNode(id: NodeId): Node?
    fun requireNode(id: NodeId): Node

    fun createNode(parentId: NodeId?, name: String, kind: NodeKind): Node
    fun deleteNode(id: NodeId)

    fun renameNode(id: NodeId, name: String)
    fun updateNodeLayout(id: NodeId, layout: NodeLayout)
    fun updateNodeText(id: NodeId, text: NodeText)
    fun updateNodeTechnology(id: NodeId, technology: TechnologyMetadata)

    fun addPort(nodeId: NodeId, port: NodePort)
    fun removePort(nodeId: NodeId, portId: String)

    fun createLink(
        parentId: NodeId?,
        name: String,
        sourceNodeId: NodeId,
        sourcePortName: String,
        targetNodeId: NodeId,
        targetPortName: String
    ): Node

    fun moveNode(id: NodeId, newParentId: NodeId?)

    fun markDirty()
    fun isDirty(): Boolean
}
```

---

### 8.3 JSON Store Interface

```kotlin
interface JsonDocumentStore {
    fun save(document: ThreadworkDocument, filePath: Path)
    fun load(filePath: Path): ThreadworkDocument
}
```

Save/load should be explicit operations.

There is no database server in the MVP.

---

## 9. JSON File Format

A saved project file shall contain the full document.

Suggested extension:

```text
.threadwork.json
```

Example structure:

```json
{
  "id": "document_001",
  "name": "carl_bridge",
  "rootNodeId": "root",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "root",
      "name": "carl_bridge",
      "kind": "Group",
      "parentId": null,
      "children": ["node_read_new_smt", "node_read_assoc_smt"],
      "incomingLinks": [],
      "outgoingLinks": [],
      "layout": {
        "x": 0.0,
        "y": 0.0,
        "width": 400.0,
        "height": 300.0
      },
      "text": {
        "source": "",
        "specification": "",
        "tests": "",
        "aiInstructions": ""
      },
      "technology": {
        "languageId": "",
        "technologyId": "",
        "compilerId": "",
        "fileExtension": "",
        "contentType": ""
      },
      "ports": [],
      "link": null,
      "metadata": {}
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {}
}
```

The persisted file format stores `nodes` as a list. Node identity comes only
from each node's `id` field; the application may rebuild an id-indexed map after
loading for runtime performance. Legacy map-shaped node files may be read for
compatibility, but new saves must emit the list format.

---

- draw grid
- draw nodes as rectangles
- draw links as polylines or straight lines
- select node
- drag node
- resize node
- pan viewport with middle/right mouse drag
- zoom viewport about the cursor/model point
- create link between ports
- redirect link source or target
- create child node inside a selected or clicked parent
- reparent nodes with the Ctrl-drag drop policy
- cut/copy/paste selected nodes with system keyboard shortcuts
- delete selected entities with Delete
- return to select mode with Escape
- select by click or window selection
- show selected state
- show node stereotype using shared core classification
- color nodes by stereotype, including libraries, tests, errors, and composites
- route links with readable port separation and labels
```

Canvas modes are limited to sticky `Select`, `Node`, and `Link` modes. Their
toolbar controls are state indicators as well as mode selectors; creation modes
remain active until the user selects another mode or presses Escape.

The canvas should use the `NodeLayout` stored in the document.

Node placement and parenting rules:

```text
- if a node is selected when creating a node, the selected node is the parent
- otherwise the new node is parented to the node under the placement cursor
- if the placement cursor is not inside a node, the new node is parented to the root
- dragging a node normally keeps its current parent
- dragging a composite moves the composite and all visible descendants
- Ctrl-drag is the explicit reparent/unparent gesture
- on Ctrl-drop, the drop cursor position, not the grabbed node center, determines the new parent
- Ctrl-drop on empty canvas reparents the moved node(s) to the root
```

Composite nodes are visual containers. Their displayed geometry shall expand to
the bounding box that envelopes their visible children, with padding. Composite
containers should use a distinct line type from terminal processing nodes.
The core canvas must not draw readiness or project-management state markers by
default; such overlays belong to plugins that define their own criteria.

Transport and error links are materialized as routed polylines between node
ports. Input and output ports must be distributed vertically on the left or right
edge of the node with readable spacing. Port slots start near the top edge and
progress downward; the required port stack height contributes to the calculated
node height. A materialized link displays one label, centered on the route, using
the link node name rather than generic input or output captions. Short links
between facing ports should use a direct segment instead of a kinked route. Link
routes should include directional arrow markers at readable intervals, at least
near the last quarter of the route. Links and port icons are drawn after node and
composite bodies so internal composite links remain visible.

An expanded composite reserves sufficient horizontal clearance between its
children and both boundaries for port stubs, labels, and a routing lane. A link
owned by an expanded composite is routed within that composite; the owning
composite and its ancestors are containers, not obstacles that the link must
route around.

Usage/dependency links are annotations, not data-flow lines. They should not draw
a direct line between the library and the dependent node. Instead, the service
library shows dependent flyouts on its right side, and each dependent processing
unit shows a top-anchored vertical dependency list.

The drawing surface supports ISO technical-sheet preview and SVG, PNG, and PDF
export. The export scope is the current selection, including descendants of a
selected composite, or the complete drawing when the selection is empty. Its
model-space bounding box is transformed into paper space using the selected
format and scale. Scaling changes the represented sheet dimensions in model
space; it does not resize model entities.

The complete margin-inset drawing frame is available for model content. Sheet
planning must not subtract the cartouche/title block or parts-list footprint
from this area; these elements overlay the drawing area and the user is
responsible for arranging content around them.

For fixed ISO formats, the user may enable multipage PDF layout. When the
transformed bounding box exceeds one page, the planner covers it with the
required number of rows and columns. These tiles are overlapping viewports onto
one assembled technical sheet, not independent technical sheets: the drawing
frame, title block, parts list, and folding marks occur once in assembled-sheet
coordinates and are clipped across physical pages as necessary. Adjacent page
windows overlap in paper space by a configurable distance, defaulting to 5 mm.
Preview page seams are rendered as thin guides above the drawing and are omitted
from export. Exported pages instead carry matching registration crosses inside
overlap zones to support alignment after printing and assembly. The PDF contains
one physical page per planned tile. Multipage layout does not apply to roll
formats; disabling it retains the single-sheet planning behavior. The editor
grid is never exported.

---

### 11.4 Node Editor Panel

Shows editable content for selected node.

Required tabs:

```text
- Source
- Specification
- Tests
- AI Instructions
- Metadata
- Ports
- Link
```

The four text tabs shall use the code editor component where useful.

The metadata, ports, and link tabs may use native Compose controls.

---

## 12. CodeMirror WebView Integration

### 12.1 Principle

CodeMirror shall be treated as an embedded editor engine, not as the application platform.

The application remains Kotlin-first.

The WebView contains only:

```text
- CodeMirror editor
- minimal JavaScript bridge
- static editor HTML/CSS/JS
```

---

### 12.2 Kotlin Adapter Interface

```kotlin
interface CodeEditorAdapter {
    fun setText(text: String)
    fun getText(): String

    fun setLanguage(languageId: String)
    fun setTechnology(technology: TechnologyMetadata)

    fun setReadOnly(readOnly: Boolean)

    fun setDiagnostics(diagnostics: List<EditorDiagnostic>)
    fun setCompletionContext(context: EditorCompletionContext)

    fun focus()

    var onTextChanged: ((String) -> Unit)?
    var onCursorChanged: ((EditorCursor) -> Unit)?
    var onCompletionRequested: ((CompletionRequest) -> List<CompletionSuggestion>)?
}
```

No other module should depend on CodeMirror directly.

---

### 12.3 JavaScript Bridge

The WebView editor shall expose bridge messages such as:

```text
Kotlin -> WebView
- setText
- setLanguage
- setDiagnostics
- setCompletionItems
- setTheme
- focus

WebView -> Kotlin
- textChanged
- cursorChanged
- completionRequested
- editorReady
```

Bridge payloads shall be JSON.

---

### 12.4 CodeMirror Completion Source

The CodeMirror editor shall register a custom completion source.

When completion is requested, JavaScript sends the current editor state to Kotlin:

```json
{
  "nodeId": "node_read_assoc_smt",
  "textSection": "source",
  "languageId": "kotlin",
  "cursorOffset": 58,
  "prefix": "out",
  "lineText": "output[\""
}
```

Kotlin returns completion suggestions:

```json
[
  {
    "label": "read_assoc_smt",
    "insertText": "read_assoc_smt",
    "kind": "OutputPort",
    "detail": "output port",
    "documentation": "Output port of read_assoc_smt"
  }
]
```

CodeMirror displays them.

---

## 13. Metadata-Aware Completion Service

### 13.1 Purpose

The completion service generates suggestions from the current node context.

It shall not be tied to CodeMirror.

It is a core application service.

---

### 13.2 Completion Service Interface

```kotlin
interface NodeCompletionService {
    fun getSuggestions(request: CompletionRequest): List<CompletionSuggestion>
}
```

```kotlin
data class CompletionRequest(
    val nodeId: NodeId,
    val textSection: NodeTextSection,
    val languageId: String,
    val technologyId: String,
    val cursorOffset: Int,
    val fullText: String,
    val currentLine: String,
    val prefix: String
)
```

```kotlin
data class CompletionSuggestion(
    val label: String,
    val insertText: String,
    val kind: CompletionSuggestionKind,
    val detail: String = "",
    val documentation: String = ""
)
```

```kotlin
enum class CompletionSuggestionKind {
    InputPort,
    OutputPort,
    Import,
    SiblingNode,
    ParentNode,
    ChildNode,
    LinkedSourceNode,
    LinkedTargetNode,
    Library,
    Keyword,
    Snippet,
    CompilerSymbol
}
```

---

### 13.3 Required Suggestion Sources

For the selected node, the completion service should suggest:

```text
- input port names
- output port names
- incoming link source nodes
- outgoing link target nodes
- sibling node names
- child node names
- parent node name
- imported libraries
- technology-specific helper symbols
- compiler-provided runtime symbols
```

Example suggestions:

```text
input["smt_incident"]
input["car_wo"]

output["assoc_carl_smt"]
output["assoc_carl_snow"]

import["lib_carl_db"]
import["lib_smt_soap"]
```

---

### 13.4 Technology-Specific Suggestions

The completion service should delegate part of the work to technology providers.

```kotlin
interface TechnologyCompletionProvider {
    fun supports(languageId: String, technologyId: String): Boolean

    fun getSuggestions(
        node: Node,
        document: ThreadworkDocument,
        request: CompletionRequest
    ): List<CompletionSuggestion>
}
```

For example, a Kotlin/JVM provider may suggest:

```text
input["name"]
output["name"].add(value)
output["name"].push(value)
```

A future Python provider may suggest:

```text
inputs["name"]
outputs["name"].append(value)
```

---

## 14. Compiler Architecture

### 14.1 Compiler Plugin Interface

```kotlin
interface CompilerPlugin {
    val id: String
    val displayName: String

    fun supports(document: ThreadworkDocument): Boolean

    fun validate(document: ThreadworkDocument): List<CompilerDiagnostic>

    fun compile(
        document: ThreadworkDocument,
        options: CompilerOptions
    ): CompilationResult
}
```

---

### 14.2 Compilation Result

```kotlin
data class CompilationResult(
    val generatedProject: GeneratedProject?,
    val diagnostics: List<CompilerDiagnostic>,
    val success: Boolean
)
```

```kotlin
data class GeneratedProject(
    val name: String,
    val files: List<GeneratedFile>
)
```

```kotlin
data class GeneratedFile(
    val path: String,
    val content: String,
    val originNodeId: NodeId?,
    val reason: String
)
```

---

### 14.3 Naive Compiler Execution Model

The first compiler shall generate deterministic sequential code.

For each composite node:

```text
1. execute child processor/composite nodes in document order
2. execute child link nodes in document order
```

No concurrency.

No async scheduling.

No race analysis.

No optimization.

---

### 14.4 Generated Project Goal

The compiler should emit a real source-code project.

For the first Kotlin/JVM compiler:

```text
generated-project/
├── settings.gradle.kts
├── build.gradle.kts
└── src/
    └── main/
        └── kotlin/
            └── generated/
                ├── Main.kt
                ├── Runtime.kt
                └── nodes/
                    ├── ReadNewSmt.kt
                    ├── ReadAssocSmt.kt
                    └── ...
```

The generated project should be buildable with Gradle if the generated user code is valid.

---

## 15. Runtime Model for Generated Code

The first compiler shall emit a minimal runtime support layer.

Conceptual runtime:

```kotlin
class RuntimeContext {
    val inputs: MutableMap<String, MutableList<Any?>> = mutableMapOf()
    val outputs: MutableMap<String, MutableList<Any?>> = mutableMapOf()
    val imports: MutableMap<String, Any?> = mutableMapOf()
}
```

Processor function shape:

```kotlin
fun runNode(context: RuntimeContext) {
    // user source text inserted or referenced here
}
```

Link function shape:

```kotlin
fun runLink(context: RuntimeContext, source: String, target: String) {
    val sourceQueue = context.outputs.getOrPut(source) { mutableListOf() }
    val targetQueue = context.inputs.getOrPut(target) { mutableListOf() }

    while (sourceQueue.isNotEmpty()) {
        targetQueue.add(sourceQueue.removeAt(0))
    }
}
```

Composite function shape:

```kotlin
fun runComposite(context: RuntimeContext) {
    runProcessorA(context)
    runProcessorB(context)

    runLink(context, "processorA.output", "processorB.input")
}
```

---

## 16. Diagnostics

Diagnostics shall be associated with the original node where possible.

```kotlin
data class CompilerDiagnostic(
    val severity: DiagnosticSeverity,
    val message: String,
    val nodeId: NodeId? = null,
    val textSection: NodeTextSection? = null,
    val line: Int? = null,
    val column: Int? = null
)
```

```kotlin
enum class DiagnosticSeverity {
    Info,
    Warning,
    Error
}
```

Diagnostics should be shown in:

```text
- node inspector
- editor gutter if location is known
- compiler output panel
```

---

## 17. Commands and Undo/Redo

The document should be modified through command objects where practical.

Example commands:

```text
CreateNodeCommand
DeleteNodeCommand
MoveNodeCommand
ResizeNodeCommand
UpdateNodeTextCommand
CreateLinkCommand
DeleteLinkCommand
UpdateMetadataCommand
```

This gives:

```text
- undo
- redo
- dirty-state tracking
- easier testing
```

For MVP, text editing may be batched rather than recording every keystroke.

---

## 18. Validation Rules

The document validation service should check:

```text
- every child id exists
- every parent id exists or is null
- parent/child references are consistent
- every incoming link id exists
- every outgoing link id exists
- link nodes have non-null link data
- link source node exists
- link target node exists
- source port exists
- target port exists
- source port direction is Output
- target port direction is Input
- no duplicate child id in same parent
- no duplicate port name for same direction on same node
```

Compiler validation may add stricter rules.

---

## 19. Migration from Current Implementation

The current implementation stores:

```text
- boxes/drawables
- metadata JSON
- technology/language rows
- calculated DB views for hierarchy and links
```

The rewrite shall not depend on MariaDB.

However, a migration importer may later read the existing exported JSON shape.

Useful mappings:

```text
Current anchor.x      -> NodeLayout.x
Current anchor.y      -> NodeLayout.y
Current size.x        -> NodeLayout.width
Current size.y        -> NodeLayout.height

Current parent.ref    -> Node.parentId
Current children      -> Node.children
Current incomingLinks -> Node.incomingLinks
Current outgoingLinks -> Node.outgoingLinks

Current metadata.text -> NodeText.source
Current technology    -> TechnologyMetadata
Current ent_type      -> NodeKind or metadata["legacyEntityType"]
```

---

## 20. MVP Scope

The MVP shall implement:

```text
1. Open desktop application
2. Create new document
3. Save document as JSON
4. Load document from JSON
5. Display hierarchy tree
6. Display canvas with nodes and links
7. Create, move, resize, rename, and delete nodes
8. Create links between nodes/ports
9. Edit four node text sections
10. Use CodeMirror for source/spec/test/AI text editing
11. Generate metadata-aware completions
12. Compile using first naive Kotlin/JVM compiler
13. Show compiler diagnostics
14. Export generated project to folder
```

---

## 21. Non-MVP Scope

The MVP shall not implement:

```text
- database backend
- real-time collaboration
- advanced concurrent scheduling
- advanced graph auto-layout
- full language-server integration
- plugin marketplace
- cross-language compilation
- cloud synchronization
- visual diff/merge
```

These should be avoided until the core model, editor, and naive compiler work reliably.

---

## 22. Agent Work Packages

The implementation should be split into coding-agent tasks.

```text
- Node

---

## 23. Main Architectural Rules

### Rule 1

The core module owns the shared model.

No UI-specific types shall leak into the core model.

---

### Rule 2

The document is stored in memory during editing.

Persistence is explicit JSON save/load.

---

### Rule 3

CodeMirror is an implementation detail of the editor adapter.

The application shall not become a JavaScript application.

---

### Rule 4

Metadata-aware completions are generated by Kotlin services, not hardcoded inside CodeMirror JavaScript.

---

### Rule 5

Links are first-class nodes.

A link is not merely a canvas line.

---

### Rule 6

The first compiler is sequential and deterministic.

No concurrency until the model and generated-project workflow are stable.

---

## 24. Summary

The rewrite shall be a Kotlin desktop application centered around a single shared node model. The active document shall live in memory and be saved/loaded as JSON. The UI shall use Compose Multiplatform, with CodeMirror embedded in a WebView only for rich text/code editing. The editor must receive metadata-aware completions from Kotlin services based on the selected node, its ports, links, parent, children, siblings, imports, language, and technology. The first compiler shall be a naive Kotlin/JVM project generator that produces a buildable source-code project from the node hierarchy.
