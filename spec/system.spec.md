# Single-Node Object Model Specification

> The canonical design principles for this model are in the
> [Threadwork Design Guide](../docs/design-guide.md). This older foundational
> specification describes the structural model; the guide supplies the
> responsibility, library, result, error, and topology semantics.

## 1. Core Principle

The entire document model is built from one object type:

```text
Node
```

Every object in the application is a node.

A node may behave as:

```text
- a composite
- a terminal source-code unit
- a link
- a visual container
- a workflow step
- a generated-project unit
```

But these are roles, not separate structural classes.

The node object should be flexible enough to represent all of them.

Structural flexibility does not mean that every node should contain an entire
workflow. A processing node normally represents the employment of one
specialized capability. Reusable algorithms and class/method implementations
belong in library nodes; result and error contracts belong on typed ports and
links; the surrounding network shows who calls whom and how failures are
handled.

---

## 2. Node Structure

A node contains:

```text
Node
- id
- parent_id
- name
- kind
- metadata
- children
- source_text
- specification_text
- tests_text
- ai_instruction_text
- x
- y
- width
- height
- link_data
- ports
```

Where:

```text
children
```

may be empty.

If `children.length == 0`, the node is terminal from the hierarchy point of view.

If `children.length > 0`, the node is composite from the hierarchy point of view.

This does not necessarily prevent a node with children from also having source text.

---

## 3. Terminal vs Composite

A node is terminal when:

```text
children.length == 0
```

A node is composite when:

```text
children.length > 0
```

This is a structural distinction.

It is independent from semantic kind.

For example, the following are all allowed by the model:

```text
- terminal processor node
- composite processor node
- terminal link node
- composite node with source code
- node with no source code and no children
```

The compiler decides what is meaningful.

---

## 4. Four Text Fields

Each node has four main text fields:

```text
source_text
specification_text
tests_text
ai_instruction_text
```

### 4.1 Source Text

The implementation body, source code, script, generated template, or manual procedure body.

### 4.2 Specification Text

The human-readable or machine-readable description of what the node is supposed to do.

### 4.3 Tests Text

Tests, validation rules, expected examples, manual test cases, or generated test templates.

### 4.4 AI Instruction Text

Instructions intended for AI coding agents or other AI-based generation tools.

This field should be used to tell an AI agent how to implement, modify, test, or reason about the node.

---

## 5. Canvas Layout Data

Each node stores its own two-dimensional canvas placement:

```text
x
y
width
height
```

This means graphical layout is part of the document model.

That is acceptable and useful because the model is not merely abstract code; it is also an editable visual artifact.

The GUI can render the node directly using these fields.

Example:

```text
Node visual rectangle:
- x: 120
- y: 80
- width: 240
- height: 140
```

---

## 6. Node Kind

The `kind` field describes the intended semantic role of the node.

Recommended initial values:

```text
NodeKind
- node
- processor
- link
- group
- note
```

For the strict MVP, this can be reduced to:

```text
NodeKind
- processor
- link
- group
```

However, the core model should not become too dependent on this enum.

A compiler may use `kind`, metadata, children, ports, or links to decide what the node means.

---

## 7. Link Representation Inside a Node

Since links are also nodes, a link node should store its link-specific data inside optional fields.

```text
link_data
- source_node_id
- source_port_name
- target_node_id
- target_port_name
```

A link node still has:

```text
- children
- text fields
- metadata
- canvas coordinates
```

Even if most compilers ignore some of those fields for links.

This keeps the model uniform.

---

## 8. Ports

A processor-like node may define ports.

```text
ports
- name
- direction
- data_type
- metadata
```

Where direction is:

```text
- input
- output
```

A link connects one output port to one input port.

---

## 9. Metadata

Metadata remains generic.

```text
metadata
- programming_language
- technology
- compiler
- runtime
- user_properties
```

This lets the same node be interpreted differently by different compilers.

---

## 10. Important Architectural Decision

The node class is not just a data structure for source code.

It is the universal document atom.

It carries:

```text
- hierarchy
- implementation
- specification
- tests
- AI instructions
- visual position
- compiler metadata
- communication information
```

This is the heart of the application.

---

## 11. Consequence for the Rewrite

The rewrite should not begin by designing many model classes.

The first coding-agent task should be:

```text
Implement a robust single Node model and repository around it.
```

The model can later expose helper functions such as:

```text
is_terminal(node)
is_composite(node)
is_link(node)
is_processor(node)
get_child_nodes(node)
get_link_nodes(node)
get_processor_nodes(node)
```

But these should be derived interpretations, not separate base classes.

---

## 12. Recommended Core API

The core model package should expose operations like:

```text
create_node(parent_id, name)
delete_node(node_id)
move_node(node_id, new_parent_id)
rename_node(node_id, new_name)

set_node_text(node_id, text_kind, value)
get_node_text(node_id, text_kind)

set_node_layout(node_id, x, y, width, height)
get_node_layout(node_id)

add_child(parent_id, child_id)
remove_child(parent_id, child_id)

set_node_kind(node_id, kind)

set_link_endpoints(
    link_node_id,
    source_node_id,
    source_port_name,
    target_node_id,
    target_port_name
)
```

---

## 13. Compiler Interpretation

The compiler should receive the same generic node structure.

It should classify nodes by interpretation:

```text
if node.kind == "link":
    compile as link

else if node.children.length > 0:
    compile as composite

else:
    compile as terminal processor
```

This is a simple default rule.

More advanced compilers may override it.

---

## 14. Minimal JSON Shape

A practical serialized node may look like:

```json
{
  "id": "node_001",
  "parent_id": null,
  "name": "Root Application",
  "kind": "group",
  "metadata": {
    "programming_language": null,
    "technology": null,
    "compiler": null,
    "runtime": null,
    "user_properties": {}
  },
  "text": {
    "source": "",
    "specification": "",
    "tests": "",
    "ai_instructions": ""
  },
  "layout": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0,
    "width": 240,
    "height": 120
  },
  "ports": [],
  "link": null,
  "children": []
}
```

A link node:

```json
{
  "id": "link_001",
  "parent_id": "root",
  "name": "A.output -> B.input",
  "kind": "link",
  "metadata": {},
  "text": {
    "source": "",
    "specification": "Move packets from A.output to B.input.",
    "tests": "",
    "ai_instructions": ""
  },
  "layout": {
    "x": 300,
    "y": 160,
    "width": 120,
    "height": 40
  },
  "ports": [],
  "link": {
    "source_node_id": "node_a",
    "source_port_name": "output",
    "target_node_id": "node_b",
    "target_port_name": "input"
  },
  "children": []
}
```

---

## 15. Updated System Definition

The application is based on a single recursive node class. Every node may contain children, four editable text fields, metadata, link information, ports, and two-dimensional canvas layout. Terminal nodes are simply nodes without children. Composite nodes are nodes with children. Link nodes are ordinary nodes whose metadata describes a connection between one output and one input. The GUI edits and visualizes this node graph, while compiler plugins interpret the same node hierarchy into source-code projects, executables, documentation, AI-agent tasks, tests, or human workflows.
