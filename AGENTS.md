# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Threadwork is a Kotlin/JVM topology-first IDE and compiler framework. Keep changes within the existing module boundaries:

- `core/`: serializable `ThreadworkDocument`/node model, classification, diagnostics, and validation.
- `storage-json/`: repository mutations and `.orch` JSON persistence.
- `completion-core/`: model- and technology-aware editor completions.
- `compiler-api/`: compiler, virtual-file, and layout-strategy contracts.
- `compilers-impl/`: generic/template, Kotlin, Node.js, PHP, and compiler-compiler implementations.
- `assets/`: licensed fonts, SVG icon sources, and generated resources.
- `app-desktop/`: CLI, Swing UI, canvas, sheet export, plugins, and code editor.
- `spec/`: functional and architectural specifications.

## Design Guide (Read First)

Before designing or implementing a workflow, read
[`docs/design-guide.md`](docs/design-guide.md). It is the architectural
manifesto for both human and machine contributors:

- libraries define reusable algorithms and capabilities;
- processing nodes employ capabilities and route one principal result plus one
  coherent error family;
- Type entities define values and error contracts crossing boundaries;
- links expose data flow, error flow, calls, dependencies, and recovery.

Keep business definition in libraries, business employment in processing nodes,
and the responsibility/failure topology visible in the model. These are
guiding defaults, not a prohibition against explicit, documented exceptions.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use the Gradle wrapper with the workspace-local cache:

- `GRADLE_USER_HOME=.gradle-user ./gradlew test`: compile all modules and run tests.
- `GRADLE_USER_HOME=.gradle-user ./gradlew :app-desktop:run --args='desktop'`: launch the editor.
- `GRADLE_USER_HOME=.gradle-user ./gradlew :app-desktop:run --args='validate build/sample.orch'`: validate a project.
- `GRADLE_USER_HOME=.gradle-user ./gradlew clean fatJar -Prelease_number=1.7.0`: create `dist/threadwork-1.7.0.jar`.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use 4-space Kotlin indentation, trailing commas in multiline declarations, and packages under `com.threadwork`. Keep UI, filesystem, and concrete compiler dependencies out of `core`. Prefer established repository abstractions over parallel helpers. Preserve `.orch` compatibility unless a task explicitly changes the persisted contract.

## Testing Guidelines

Tests use `kotlin.test` under each module's `src/test/kotlin`. Add focused tests beside the behavior changed; broaden coverage for model, persistence, compiler, and cross-module contracts. Use descriptive behavior names such as `create link synchronizes endpoints`.

## Commits & Pull Requests

Use imperative, scoped commits such as `Rename application to Threadwork`. Pull requests should summarize behavior, list affected modules/specs, report test results, link issues, and include screenshots for visible UI changes.

## Agent-Specific Instructions

Preserve user-authored project content and unrelated worktree changes. Do not reorganize modules or rename specification files unless explicitly required.

# response guidelines

- always respond in the sum up in the commitizen format

All commits must follow the Commitizen / Conventional Commits standard using the structural layout below:

## Commitizen / Conventional Commits standard
```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>
```

### Field Definitions

* **`<type>`**: Must be one of the following lowercase tokens:
    * `feat`: A new feature or capability.
    * `fix`: A bug fix.
    * `docs`: Documentation changes only.
    * `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
    * `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
    * `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
    * `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
    * `chore`: Changes to the build process, auxiliary tools, or libraries/dependencies.
* **`<scope>`**: Optional. A noun naming the specific codebase component or module affected, wrapped in parentheses (e.g., `(parser)`, `(auth)`, `(runtime)`).
* **`<subject>`**: A brief, imperative-mood summary of the change. Do not capitalize the first letter. Do not end with a period.
* **`<body>`**: Optional. Separate from the subject with exactly one blank line. Provides the motivation for the change and contrasts it with previous behavior.

additionally the body should be structured as folows:
- summary of what was asked/demande
- summary of the solution or answer
- bulleted list of technical/functional modifications or planning steps ( what you print out by default in the summary )



### Examples

```text
fix(editor): persist and reveal mapped compiler diagnostics

  - Diagnostics are persisted on each node and restored with the project.
  - New validation/compilation clears previous diagnostics.
  - Gutter markers now reveal the mapped editor, section, and source line automatically.
  - Nodes with diagnostics show a red warning badge in the diagram.
  - Runtime/override errors without source-map entries are retained and shown as unmapped instead of being discarded.
  - The status bar now shows:
    generated-file:line:column -> node section source-line:column

  git diff --check passes. Full Gradle compilation remains blocked by the environment’s existing wildcard-IP Gradle startup failure.

```

```text
fix(compiler): resolve memory leaks on dynamic execution evaluation loops
```
